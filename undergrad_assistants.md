# Undergraduate Laboratory Assistants

by Dom Appleton and JPT

## Responsibilities Overview

Each undergraduate lab assistant (ULA) performs a variety of important tasks in support of the research group's effort.  The most important general skills are:
1. *Reliability* - show up on your shift days, complete the work, and communicate with your colleagues and supervisors if you can't make it.
2. *Attention to detail* - researchers in the lab, including your fellow students, spend many years generating fly strains and reagents in pursuit of their studies, so take good care !

#### The specific tasks and responsibilities of ULAs include:

- **Fly Flipping** - the flies can only live so long in a vial/bottle and need to be transferred to fresh containers regularly
- **Noting Dead/Dying Stocks** - keep track of which stocks are dead or almost dead (< 5 flies)
- **Maintaining Cleanliness** - keep your work areas and equipment clean and tidy
- **Re-stocking Fly Food** - make sure there are fresh vials/bottles with food in the lab at all times (including for weekends)
- **Autoclaving Waste** - sterilizing and disposing of biological waste
- **Fetching and Swapping CO2 Tanks** - removing empty carbon dioxide tanks and replacing them with fresh ones
- **Purchasing Supplies from Stockroom** - obtaining needed items from the stockroom
- **Cleaning Dishes** - or rather, glassware and plates
- **Making Eggcaps** - mixing up media and pouring new egg caps
- **Other Misc Tasks** - researchers may occasionally ask for other assistance

Should you have any questions or require help, don't hesitate to get in touch with your scheduler (Dom), Jay, or Jason.

## Scheduling

We will make every effort to schedule two assistants per day.  One assistant will be denoted the **primary** and is responsible for all flipping for the day.  The other, **secondary** assistant is responsible for all the other various tasks as outlined above.

Note that these roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive:  if the primary needs extra help or is out, the secondary should assist with flipping; if there is little flipping to do for the day, the primary should assist with the other tasks once flipping is completed.  You can and should ask if your colleagues need help with anything should you believe you've run out of things to do (and double check the responsibilities list, of course).

You should, in general, be scheduled for at least 1 primary and 1 secondary shift per week. See the schedule for details, and *we emphasize again to communicate any changes in your own availability ASAP*.

## Responsibility Details

### Primary's Responsibility:  Fly Flipping

Flipping flies is the most important responsibility of ULAs.  Each day, the primary assistant must carefully:
- ***Flip*** all vials & bottles corresponding to the flipping calendar day
    - be careful not to let flies escape, and be **EXTRA** careful to not let any foreign flies in -- this could ruin years of work
- ***Replace the date labels*** with new labels for the current date using the appropriate color indicated on the calendar
- ***Note dead/dying stocks*** and send an email to Dr. Tennessen (also cc Jay) noting any vials that are dead or almost dead (< 5 flies).  Record the specific name on the vial, the box it came from, and at which temperature.  Check to see if there's a corresponding backup stock at room temp or the 16C room if you are able.
- ***Sanitize your station*** before and after flipping using 70% ethanol.  Get rid of any crusty bits and keep the area tidy and uncluttered in general.
- ***Restock the fly food***, replacing any of the food you used by fetching fresh vials/bottles from the fly food kitchen downstairs before it closes (around 2p).  Keep the food covered and/or bagged to avoid contamination.

### Secondary's Responsibilies

The secondary assistant has a number of tasks to fulfill; not all will need to be performed each day, but all must be checked.

- ***Autoclaving any waste*** in the biohazard bins if they are at least halfway full.
    - Remove the bag, loosely twist and tape the top (allowing some room for airflow) with autoclabe tape, add a biohazard sign, and autoclave for 1h on gravity cycle.  Don't forget to dispose of the bag once treated !
- ***Replacing CO2 containers*** by swapping out empty tanks for fresh ones, located downstairs on the loading dock.  Ask for the cage combination.
- ***Stockroom Purchases*** as needed from the store downstairs in the basement.  Use the lab purchasing card, and bring back the receipt.  Some commonly required supplies include:
    - Colored tape, Kimwipes, pipet tips, gloves, autoclave waste bags, paper towels
- ***Restocking the food shelf*** with at least 2 trays of vials and 4 trays of bottles at all times
- ***Cleaning glassware and plates*** in the sink, using glass cleaner and DI H2O for glassware and tap water + dish soap for the caps and any other materials.
- ***Making egg caps*** if there is less than a full container of them in the food fridge. As the least popular and most labor intensive secondary job, if you are tasked to this, you don't need to worry as much about other tasks for the day.  Instructions are located on a sheet in the same drawer as the flipping calendar.

## Closing Remarks

Your colleagues appreciate your contribution toward keeping the lab running smoothly.  Reach out to them, your scheduler, Jay, or Dr. Tennessen if you need anything !
